## Why does this exist?

Reasonable Footnotes exists to make website footnotes _slightly_ nicer.

Footnotes are useful in many kinds of writing. The most common implementation of footnotes on websites involves anchor elements jumping the reader around the document.

Footnotes should be easier to read.

Reasonable Footnotes is attempts to improve on this experience by allowing the reader to read the footnotes in-place.

This is not a new idea (see: similar projects). Reasonable Footnotes is an attempt at a minimum, reasonable implementation of in-place readable footnotes.

## Can I use this?

Reasonable Footnotes is free software. The full, annotated source code is available, and it is released here under the MIT License.

The current version (0.2.0) is usable, but in steady development. Check back later for a more stable release.

## How might I use this?

Reasonable Footnotes is meant to be a drop-in enhancement to your website footnotes. If everyone is lucky (and your existing markup conforms to some reasonable expectations) then it should _just work_. Fingers crossed.

## Who made this?

A Reasonable Website was created by [Matthew Howell](https://www.matthewhowell.net), a human, trying his best. Like everything in life, it couldn't exist without the help and generosity of others.

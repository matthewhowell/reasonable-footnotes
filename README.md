## Why does this exist?

Reasonable Footnotes exists to make website footnotes slightly nicer.

Footnotes are useful and benefit from an enhanced user experience. The most common implementation of HTML footnotes involves an anchor element that links to a location farther down the page which displays the actual note. Then, that note needs another anchor element to link back to the location of the original footnote link.

Footnotes should be easier to read.

Reasonable Footnotes keeps the inline anchor links, but instead of jumping the user around the page, the footnotes are displayed inline.

This is not a new idea. Reasonable Footnotes is an attempt at a minimum, reasonable implementation of inline footnotes.

## Can I use this?

Reasonable Footnotes is free software. The full, annotated source code is available, and it is released here under the MIT License.

The current version (0.1.0) is usable, but in steady development. Check back later for a more stable release.

## How might I use this?

Reasonable Footnotes is meant to be a drop-in enhancement to your website footnotes. If everyone is lucky (and your existing markup conforms to expectations) then it should _just work_. Fingers crossed.

## Who made this?

A Reasonable Website was created by [Matthew Howell](https://www.matthewhowell.net), a human, trying his best. Like everything in life, it couldn't exist without the help and generosity of others.
